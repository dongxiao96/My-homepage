# Welcome to Dong Xiao's Research Homepage

This homepage showcases my research conducted during my PhD studies at the Department of Aeronautics, Imperial College London. My work focuses on impact localisation, force estimation and damage detection using passive structural health monitoring techniques, advancing the safety and reliability of engineering structures.

Here, you will find a list of my publications, which detail the key findings and contributions of my research. Additionally, I have provided access to the experimental data and codes associated with my publications, enabling readers to explore, validate, and build upon my work.

Feel free to contact me with any questions about my research or to discuss opportunities for future collaboration.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find these resources valuable in understanding and furthering research in this exciting field.
